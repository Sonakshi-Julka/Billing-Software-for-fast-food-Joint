This project is a **DBMS Billing System**, implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. 
The system allows users to manage billing tasks, such as generating bills, adding new entries, and managing customer and product information.
It can be extended and customized for use in small retail systems, e-commerce, or similar applications.

**Features**
- **Billing Interface**: Generate customer bills based on product information and prices.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products in the system.
- **Customer Management**: Store and manage customer details.
- **Receipt Generation**: Provides a formatted receipt for each billing transaction.
- **Database Integration**: Integration with a database for persistent storage of product and customer information.
